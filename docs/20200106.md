# Introduction

I'm currently refitting a 1980s 16ft Sprite Carvan and have installed 300W of solar panel. Shortly, when they are delivered, I'll be adding an inverter along with ~100ah@24 volts storage batteries and all the other wiring, breakers, charge controllers, thermostat for the fridge etc alongside the already fitted LED lighting.

This project is is to monitor and dashboard power usage and production. As the carvan will likely be parked in range of WiFi I'll also upload the data to an IOT service so that I can keep an eye on bettery condition, power production and usage.

There are several phase of the project
1. Initial setup with basic monitoring  
At the end of this phase I should be able to view a basic dashboard on a mobile phone, via WiFi, that shows power production, battery levels and power consumption
1. Enhanced monitoring  
At the end of this phase the dashboard should show instant power readings along with sliding window averages for comparison and a history of readings
1. IOT Hookup  
At the end of this phase the system should connect to WiFi and upload all data to an IOT hub for longer term data retention and analysis


Somewhere in the I'll also add temperature control for the fridge and possible reintroduce the caravan lighting control via webpage that exists [here](https://github.com/ScollyNZ/nz.co.scoltock.caravan/)
