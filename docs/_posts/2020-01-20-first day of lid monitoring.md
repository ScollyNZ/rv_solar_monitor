# First Successful Day

After a couple of attempts over the last few days the lid angle monitoring is working, upload the measurement to [ThingSpeak](thingspeask.com) every five minutes, which is probably too frequent but it works.

The dashboard looks like this

The day started out cloudy and misty so didn't warm up until mid day. There was a cool breeze and some clouds around 1830. It warmed up again and the irrigation came on at 1930, resulting the in lid closing completely.

Final code for this version is [here](https://github.com/ScollyNZ/rv_solar_monitor/tree/v1.0.0.0)
